# Regression

<br><br>

## Data Preparation

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r biblioteki, message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(zoo)
library(class)
library(kernlab)
library(verification)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(olsrr)
library(glmnet)
library(MLmetrics)
library(kernlab)
```

### General outlook on data

<br>

<font size=4> I read in the data </font>
```{r, data241}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/orjen/OneDrive/Desktop/Projekt R/traffic_train.csv")
```
<br>

<font size=4> I check if there are duplicates or NAs </font>

```{r, data2}

colSums(is.na(data)) %>% 
  sort()
data[which(duplicated(data)),]

```
<br>

<font size=4> Not really so we can move forward and check pattern in time </font>

<br>
```{r, pattern_date, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data, aes(x=date_time, y=traffic))+
  geom_point()

```
<br>


### Time preparation

<font size=4> I extract the most interesting part of date-time </font>

<br>
```{r, date}

data$date_time <- as.POSIXct(data$date_time, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
yq <- as.yearqtr(data$date_time, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
data$kwartal<-format(yq, format = "%q")
data$kwartal<- as.factor(data$kwartal)
data$hour<-format(data$date_time, format='%H')
data$month<-format(data$date_time, format='%m')
data$day<-weekdays(data$date_time)

```

```{r, date2, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data[which(is.na(data$date_time)),]
data<-na.omit(data)

```

<br>

<font size=4> I apply a function to transform hours to parts of the day according to the plot given below. It's also logical and even based in life that people are trying to commute to home in different hours. The best feeling is driving a car in an empty city at 3 am<font/>

```{r, function 1}

time_of_the_day<-function(x) {
  result<-list()
  if(x>=6 & x<=8){
    result<-"Traffic_morning_peak_hour"
  } 
  else if(x>8 & x<15){
    result<-"Working_hours"}
  else if(x>=15 & x<=17){
    result<-"Traffic_evening_peak_hour"}
  else{
    result <-"night"}
  return(result)
}

```

```{r, pattern_date2, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data, aes(x=hour, y=traffic))+
  geom_point()

```
<br>
<br>
<font size=4> let's apply the function </font>
```{r, time2}

data$hour2<-lapply(data$hour,time_of_the_day)
data$hour2<-as.character(data$hour2)
data$hour2<- as.factor(data$hour2)

```
<br>

### Weather preparation

<br>
<font size=4> I have to admit that we decided to not use this more rich in description weather column because
we saw many things that we have to merge and diversity provided in weather_general is good enough to judge
what should happen with the traffic. At all not every weather state should affect traffic so we just drop it 
instantly </font>
<br>


```{r, weather}

kable(table(data$weather_general)) %>%
  sort(decreasing = FALSE)

```

<br>

<font size=4> I decided to merge some of them because logicaly there are the same and should not affect our traffic. 
Of course we can check if the values are different by filtering the data but it may results in overfitting the model.
Let's keep it simple </font>

<br>

<font size=4> Things that should be merged in my opinion:
<ult>
<li> Merge fog and mist </li>
<li> Smoke and Haze </li>
<li> Squall and Thunderstorm </li>
</ult>
<br>

```{r, weather20}

data$weather_general <- as.factor(data$weather_general)

data$weather_general[data$weather_general == "Maze"] <- "Fog"
data$weather_general[data$weather_general == "Haze"] <- "Smoke"
data$weather_general[data$weather_general == "Squall"] <- "Thunderstorm"

data$weather_general <- droplevels(data$weather_general)
kable(table(data$weather_general))

```
<br>

<font size=4> We won't also use snow nor rain because those things are pretty always equal to 0 </font>

```{r, weather2}
kable(head(table(data$snow_mm),10))
kable(head(table(data$rain_mm),10))
```

<br>

<font size=4> Lets check temperature </font>

<br> 
```{r, weather3}
kable(head(table(data$temperature),10))
data<-data[-c(which(data$temperature==-273.1)),]
data<-data[-c(which(data$rain_mm>100)),]

```
<br>

<font size=4> Data seems to be various but we have some outliers (at least I dont believe that we can achieve -273.1.
Also I dropped an outlier from rain (I believe that is an ouliter) </font>

<br>

### Feature selection

<br>

<font size = 4> We also need to check if the data is at least correlated to traffic </font>


```{r correlation, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}
houses_numeric_vars <- 
  # check if variable is numeric
  sapply(data, is.numeric) %>% 
  # select those which are
  which() %>% 
  # and keep just their names
  names()

houses_correlations <- 
  cor(data[, houses_numeric_vars],
      use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

kable(houses_correlations)
```
<br>
<font size=4> Now im sure that I won't use nor rain nor snow nor covarage </font>
<br>

<font size=4> Also ANOVA for categorical values </font>

<br>
```{r ANOVA, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}
houses_categorical_vars <- 
  # check if variable is a factor
  sapply(data, is.factor) %>% 
  # select those which are
  which() %>% 
  # and keep just their names
  names()



houses_F_anova <- function(categorical_var) {
  anova_ <- aov(data$traffic ~ 
                  data[[categorical_var]]) 
  
  return(summary(anova_)[[1]][1, 4])
}

sapply(houses_categorical_vars,
       houses_F_anova) %>% 
  # in addition lets sort them
  # in the decreasing order of F
  #  and store as an object
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) -> houses_anova_all_categorical

kable(houses_anova_all_categorical)

```
<br>

<font size=4> A lot of can be improved </font>

<br>

<font szie=4> some ggplots to improve dataset </font>

<br>

```{r ggplot, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data, aes(x=day, y=traffic)) + geom_line()

```

<br>

```{r ggplot2, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data, aes(x=month, y=traffic)) + geom_boxplot()

```

<br>

<font size=4> By that we will create 2 functions to divide months and days into useful parts </font>

```{r functions23}

season_of_the_year <- function(x) {
  result<-list()
  if(x=='11' || x=='12' || x=='01'){
    result<-"Winter"
  } 
  else if(x=='07' || x=='08' || x=='09' ){
    result<-"Summer_Holidays"}
  else{
    result <-"The_Rest_of_the_season"}
  return(result)
}

day_of_the_wk<- function(x) {
  result<-list()
  if(x=='sobota' || x=='niedziela'){
    result<-"Weekend"
  } 
  else{
    result <-"Working_day"}
  return(result)
}

data$season<-lapply(data$month,season_of_the_year)
data$season<-as.character(data$season)
data$season<-as.factor(data$season)

data$day2<-lapply(data$day, day_of_the_wk)
data$day2<-as.character(data$day2)
data$day2<-as.factor(data$day2)

```

<br>
<font size=4> last ANOVA to check if we are in a better position </font>

```{r ANOVA2, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}
houses_categorical_vars <- 
  # check if variable is a factor
  sapply(data, is.factor) %>% 
  # select those which are
  which() %>% 
  # and keep just their names
  names()



houses_F_anova <- function(categorical_var) {
  anova_ <- aov(data$traffic ~ 
                  data[[categorical_var]]) 
  
  return(summary(anova_)[[1]][1, 4])
}

sapply(houses_categorical_vars,
       houses_F_anova) %>% 
  # in addition lets sort them
  # in the decreasing order of F
  #  and store as an object
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) -> houses_anova_all_categorical

kable(houses_anova_all_categorical)

```
<br>

<font size=4> That's seems like a success so I go to proceed some algorithms</font>

<br>

<font size=4> Our final dataset: </font>

```{r,finaldataset}
data_final<-data[,c(8,2,5,13,14,15)]
kable(head(data_final,20))
```
<br>


## Algorithms

<br>

<font size=5> We decided that we are going to try to use more or less those 5 algorithms </font>
<br>
<font size=4>
<ul>
  <li>OLS </li> 
  <li>LASSO </li>
  <li>RIDGE </li>
  <li>Elastic approach between them </li>
  <li>KNN </li>
  <li>SVR </li>
</ul> 
</font>

<br>

<font size=4><b>Due to computational issues I decided to present only final parameteres for every selected algorithm.
I checked a range values of K for KNN etc but including for example more possibilities for SVR would kill my computer </b> </font>

<br>

<font size=4> We will try to check both ends, I mean high variance and low bias plus low variance and high bias then we will use linear regression + Lasso/Ridge. Then we have two imporant efficient algorithms KNN which is one of the most optimal accoring to books and SVR which is also very sufficient especially if we have weird combinations in dataset </font>

<br>

### Linear regression

<br>

<font size=4> setting the right options </font

```{r,finaldataset20}
options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment",  # for non-ordinal factors
                      "contr.treatment")) # for ordinal factors
```

<br>

<font size=4> I will try 2 models, one clear and one with interactions between variables. 
I've been doing some experiments with them and which are the best so below I will show
only the best interactions I could find and that are logical for me </font>

<br>


```{r,OLS}

#model without interactions
traffic_lm <- lm(traffic~. -1, 
                 data = data_final) 

summary(traffic_lm)

#model with interactions
traffic_lm2 <- lm(traffic~. + weather_general*hour2  + day2*hour2 + weather_general*day2 -1, # best formula
                 data = data_final)
summary(traffic_lm2)

traffic_predicted <- predict(traffic_lm)
traffic_predicted2 <- predict(traffic_lm2)
```

<br>

<font size=4> let's plot real vs predicted values </font>

<br>
```{r olsplot, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}


ggplot(data.frame(real = data_final$traffic,
                  predicted = traffic_predicted),
       aes(x = predicted, 
           y = real, )) +
  geom_point(col = "blue") +
  ggtitle('Plot without interactions') +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(data.frame(real = data_final$traffic,
                  predicted = traffic_predicted2),
       aes(x = predicted, 
           y = real)) +
  geom_point(col = "blue") +
  ggtitle('Plot with interactions') +
  theme_bw()

```

### Lasso/Ridge/Elastic approach

<br>
<font size=4> The good thing about lasso/Ridge is that we can apply both of them to erase non important values 
and set aplha at a certain level to chose which one we would love to use. This method is at the other
end of bias/variance trade plot </font>

<br>

#### Ridge

<font size=4> lets start with ridge regression </font>
<br>

```{r ridge}

ctrl_cv5 <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5) ## cross-validation


parameters_ridge <- expand.grid(alpha = 0,
                                lambda = seq(0, 1e3, 1))

traffic_ridge <- train(traffic~. + weather_general*hour2  + day2*hour2 + weather_general*day2 -1,
                       data = data_final,
                       method = "glmnet", 
                       tuneGrid = parameters_ridge,
                       trControl = ctrl_cv5)

traffic_ridge$bestTune
```

<br>
<font size=4> Lamba is equals 79 so really close to the linear regression. Lets check LASSO -> RMSE about 1740 </font>
<br>


```{r LASSO}
parameters_lasso <- expand.grid(alpha = 1,
                                lambda = seq(1, 1e4, 10))

traffic_lasso<- train(traffic~. + weather_general*hour2  + day2*hour2 + weather_general*day2 -1,
                      data = data_final,
                      method = "glmnet", 
                      tuneGrid = parameters_lasso,
                      trControl = ctrl_cv5)

traffic_lasso$bestTune
```

<br>

<font size=4> lambda and alfa equals to 1, very interesting to be honest </font>

<br>

<font size=4> Let's check the elastic approach in Alpha </font>

<br>

<font size=4> I experimented some with this algorithm to check between which values of lambada/alpha I should choose.
Do thousands or houndreds are required? Not really, the best set is with lambda between 0 and 10 with alpha around 0.8 </font>


```{r elastic}
set.seed(2137) ## Let's set seed because lambda and alfa may vary but there are both really similar, just to keep it constant
parameters_elastic2 <- expand.grid(alpha = seq(0, 1, 0.2), 
                                   lambda = seq(0, 10, 0.1))

traffic_elastic <- train(traffic~. + weather_general*hour2  + day2*hour2 + weather_general*day2,
                         data = data_final,
                         method = "glmnet", 
                         tuneGrid = parameters_elastic2,
                         trControl = ctrl_cv5)


traffic_elastic$bestTune
```

<br>

<font size=4> So we may be quite sure that between those 3 algorithms we are going to the next point with an elastic approach
and alpha=0.2 with lambda = 2 </font>

<br>

```{r elastic_plot, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}
predicted2 = predict(traffic_elastic , data_final)

ggplot(data.frame(real = data_final$traffic,
                  predicted = predicted2 ),
       aes(x = predicted, 
           y = real)) +
  geom_point(col = "blue") +
  ggtitle('Alpha = 0.8, Lambda = 1') +
  theme_bw()
```

<br>

### KNN

<br>
<font size=4> I decided to use this algorithm because in my books on Machine Learning they say this algorithm may be the
most accurate one in many cases. What I mean, we don't really use any presumptions and we only
match something because of neighbours. In this case, when it's hard for my data to fit in any
kind of regression that assume for example normal distribution, or try to fit to data any coefficients
this one may be really relevant player. We will see at the end in the comparison! </font>

<br>

<font size=4> Once again i experimented between different values of K for KNN and I decided to go with 19 </font>

```{r KNN1}
ctrl_cv5 <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

k_possible <-data.frame(k=19) ## The value 19 is the best for our dataset so im gonna go with it

traffic_knn <- 
  train(traffic~. + weather_general*hour2  + day2*hour2 + weather_general*day2, 
        data = data_final,
        method = "knn",
        trControl = ctrl_cv5,
        tuneGrid = k_possible,
        preProcess = c("range"))

## k=19 is the lowest RMSE we can obtain, So I will go with that.
``` 

<br>

<font size=4> let's plot it </font>

```{r elastic_plot_knn, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}
predicted2 = predict(traffic_knn , data_final)


ggplot(data.frame(real = data_final$traffic,
                  predicted = predicted2 ),
       aes(x = predicted, 
           y = real)) +
  geom_point(col = "blue") +
  ggtitle('KNN with K=19')
  theme_bw()


```

### SVR 

<br>

<font size=4> I would like to start with a point that my laptop is kinda slow and I didn't menage to estimate 
any combination of sigma and C on a full dataset. So I drew a sample of 10% observations and then adjusted my
sigma and C. Therefore this would be the most optimal algorithm but I don't have a possibility to check it.
Thus, below I present the best possible algorithm I could estimate on a random sample.
Then of course I checked that on a biggest sample (around 30% of observations) and couple times on a full dataset.
But most estimations were conducted on small samples </font>
<br>

```{r SVR1}
parametersC_sigma2 <- 
  expand.grid(C = 415,
              sigma = 0.1)


svm_Radial2 <- train(traffic~. + weather_general*hour2  + day2*hour2 + weather_general*day2, 
                            data = data_final, 
                            method = "svmRadial",
                            tuneGrid = parametersC_sigma2,
                            trControl = ctrl_cv5)
svm_Radial2
```
<br>

```{r elastic_plot_svr, fig.show="hold", echo=FALSE}

predicted2 = predict(svm_Radial2 , data_final)

ggplot(data.frame(real = data_final$traffic,
                  predicted = predicted2 ),
       aes(x = predicted, 
           y = real)) +
  geom_point(col = "blue") +
  ggtitle('SVR with C=415 and sigma=0.1') +
  theme_bw()

```
<br>

## MAPE between all algorithms

<br>
<font size=4> I wrote a function to check it for me </font>

<br>

<font size=4> First im gonna create a data frame with our predictions
```{r MAPE }
predicted_ols <- predict(traffic_lm, data_final)
predicted_lasso_ridge <- predict(traffic_elastic , data_final)
predicted_svr <- predict(svm_Radial2 , data_final)
predicted_knn <- predict(traffic_knn, data_final)

predictions<-data.frame(predicted_ols,predicted_lasso_ridge,predicted_svr,predicted_knn)

MAPE<-matrix(8,nrow=2,ncol=4)
```

<br>
<font size=4> then let's create a function that will judge for us and return the best option
```{r MAPE2 }
for(i in 1:length(predictions))
{
  MAPE[1,i] <-colnames(predictions[i])
  MAPE[2,i] <-MAPE(unlist(predictions[i]), data_final$traffic+1)
  if(i==length(predictions))
  {
    print(paste0('The best algorithm for our dataset is ', substr(MAPE[1,which(MAPE[2,]==min(MAPE))],11,20), ' with the predicted MAPE equals to ',
           round(as.numeric(min(MAPE)),2),'%'))
    
  }
}
kable(MAPE)

```
<br>

<font size=4> So at the end I can only say that our book to Machine Learning was quite right in a judge that
KNN is very often a most optimal alogirhtm. Definitely im gonna finish this book during our summer break </font>

<font size=4> Expected error? about 2-3% in MAPE. Exactly 2.33% </font>

<br>

### General outlook on data

<br>

<font size=4> Let read the data. </font>
```{r data}
data2 = read.csv("drugs_train.csv")
```
<br>

<font size=4> My first step was to check for NAs. </font>

```{r data22}

kable(colSums(is.na(data2)) %>% 
  sort())

```
<br>

<font size=4> We do not have any NAs thus we can move forward and check which variables are characters. </font>

<br>


```{r data32}

kable(sapply(data2, is.character))
data2 = data2[,-1]

```
<br>

<font size=4> We have noticed that there is an ID column which we decided to drop because it is not valuable for us. </font>

<br>

### Age

<font size=4> As it is presented below people were divided into six age groups. However, we have noticed that its distribution is slightly imbalanced. Thus, we decided to merge groups "55-64" and "65+" into one group called "55+" to be more representative. </font>

<br>

```{r age2}

kable(table(data2$age))

data2$age[data2$age=="55-64"] <- "55+"
data2$age[data2$age == "65+"] <- "55+"

data2$age = factor(data2$age, levels = c("18-24",
                                         "25-34",
                                         "35-44",
                                         "45-54",
                                         "55+"),ordered = TRUE)

data2$age <- droplevels(data2$age)

```
### Gender

<font size=4> As of Gender variable we modified it into factors. </font>

<br>

```{r gender2}

data2$gender = factor(data2$gender, levels = c("male","female"), ordered = TRUE)

```

<br>

### Education

<font size=4> The education variable is divided into many levels, which again is not distributed evenly. We have many disproportions so we decided to merge people who left school at or before 18 into one group. </font>

<br>

```{r education2}

kable(table(data2$education))

data2$education[data2$education %in% c("Left school before 16 years",
                                       "Left school at 16 years",
                                       "Left school at 17 years",
                                       "Left school at 18 years")] <- "Left school at or before 18"

data2$education = factor(data2$education, levels = c("Left school at or before 18",
                                                     "Some college or university, no certificate or degree",
                                                     "Professional certificate/ diploma",
                                                     "University degree",
                                                     "Masters degree",
                                                     "Doctorate degree"),
                         ordered = TRUE)
data2$education <- droplevels(data2$education)

```

### Country

<font size=4> As for the country variable we have noticed that most people are from Australia or USA. However, there is small number of people from Canada and Ireland so we decided to assign them to the group of others. </font>

<br>

```{r country2}

kable(table(data2$country))

data2$country[data2$country %in% c("Canada","Ireland")] <- "Other"

```

<br>

### Ethnicity

<font size=4> We checked the Ethnicity variable and we have noticed that sample is practically homogeneous. Thus, we decided to drop it because it does not provide any reliable information regarding other ethnic groups. </font>

<br>

```{r ethnicity2}

kable(table(data2$ethnicity))
data2 = data2[,-5]

```

<br>

### Consumption

<font size=4> We believe that variables that concern consumption should be grouped because the frequency split is too broad. It was decided to downgrade it into three groups: "regularly", "occasionally" and "never". We also consider that "Consumption Chocolate" and "Consumption Caffeine" do not have any direct impact whether person consumes cocaine so we decided to drop them from our dataset.  </font>

<br>

```{r consumption2}

# Vector of consumption variables which concern us 
consumption_variables = c("consumption_alcohol", "consumption_amphetamines", 
                          "consumption_cannabis", "consumption_mushrooms", 
                          "consumption_nicotine")
# Grouping function
fun = 
  function(x){
  if (x %in% c("never used","used over a decade ago","used in last decade")){
    x = "never"}
  else if (x %in% c("used in last year","used in last month")){
    x = "occasionally"}
  else if (x %in% c("used in last week","used in last day")){ 
    x = "regularly"}
  }

# Applying grouping function
data2[consumption_variables] = unlist(lapply(data2[consumption_variables], function(y) lapply(y, fun)))

# Modifying into factors
data2[consumption_variables] = lapply(data2[consumption_variables], 
                                     function(x) factor(x, levels = c("never","occasionally","regularly"),ordered = TRUE))

# Dropping "Consumption Chocolate" and "Consumption Caffeine" variables
data2 = data2[,-c(14,16)]

```

<br>

### Personality Variables

<font size=4> Firstly, we decided to check whether personality variables have any outliers. To do that we looked at their ranges. Based on the table below we can establish that we do not have outliers. </font>

<br>

```{r outliers2}

min_max = matrix(1:14,nrow = 7, ncol = 2)
colnames(min_max) = c("Minimum", "Maximum")
rownames(min_max) = names(which(sapply(data2,is.numeric)))
min_max[,1] = apply(data2[names(which(sapply(data2,is.numeric)))],2, min)
min_max[,2] = apply(data2[names(which(sapply(data2,is.numeric)))],2, max)
kable(min_max)

```

<br>

<font size=4> Knowing the fact that we do not have any irregularities we decided to aggregate this variables and create one called "personality". It aims to present the dominant character traits. The reason behind this decision is that we believe that these variables in continuous form are not reliable because people cannot establish real level of their personality traits. What it might be valuable from that data is its hierarchical order. So, we decided to check which personality trait had the highest score and we assigned it to personality variable. </font>

<br>

```{r personality2}

data2["personality"] =  
  colnames(data2[sapply(data2,is.numeric)])[apply(data2[sapply(data2,is.numeric)],1,which.max)]

data2$personality = as.factor(data2$personality)

```

<br>

### Dependent Variable

<font size=4>We modified our dependent variable into factor. We also noticed that our dataset is strongly imbalanced. Thus, we decided to use upsampling in our analysis. </font>

```{r dependent2}

kable(table(data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month))

data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month = factor(data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month, levels = c("No","Yes"), ordered = TRUE)

data2 = data2[sapply(data2,is.factor)]

```

<br>

### Statistical Tests

<font size=4>To verify whether variables has a significant impact on cocaine consumption, we decided to run chi-squred tests. Based on the results we decided to drop the education variable because its p-value exceeded 5%.</font>

```{r chisqr2, message=TRUE}

chisqr = matrix(1:10,nrow = 10, ncol = 1)
colnames(chisqr) = c("p-value")
rownames(chisqr) = names(which(sapply(data2,is.factor)))
chisqr[,1] = apply(data2[names(which(sapply(data2,is.factor)))],2, 
                   function(x) round(chisq.test(x, data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month,correct=FALSE)$p.value,4))

kable(chisqr)
data2 = data2[,-3]
data2$education
```

<br>

## Data Modelling

### Algorithms

<br>

<font size=4> We decided that we are going to try to use 4 algorithms that are presented below: </font>
<br>
<font size=3>
<ul>
  <li>Logistic Regression </li> 
  <li>KNN </li>
  <li>SVM </li>
  <li>Random Forest </li>
</ul> 
</font>

<br>

<font size=4>Each of the presented algorithms has its own benefits and drawbacks and this is the reason why we decided to go with all of them. We wanted to compare them and choose the most accurate for this dataset. </font>

### Cross-Validation

<font size=4>Overfitting is one of the burdensome issue in Machine Learning. As we want to perform as accurate model as possible we needed to minimize that problem, so we decided to apply a Cross Validation procedure. Even though it is computationally expensive, we do not waste too much data which is extremely important in our case. Ultimately, we decided to go with five folds and three repeats. Additionally, as it was previously said, we used upsampling method.</font>

```{r cross-validation2}
options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment",  # for non-ordinal factors
                      "contr.treatment")) # for ordinal factors
set.seed(9432398) # We specify random seed

# Train control with cross-validation
ctrl_cv5 <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                         number = 5,
                         classProbs = TRUE,
                         summaryFunction = twoClassSummary,
                         repeats = 3)

ctrl_cv5$sampling = "up"

```

<br>

### Logistic regression

<font size=4> Our first algorithm was logistic regression. We decided start with it because it is easy method to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train. To increase the performance of the model we decided to add some interactions. We believed that the impact of the addictive substances might differ depending on people's character traits. We decided to go with the following variables, cannabis consumption, amphetamines consumption and mushrooms consumption, because they constitute so called soft and hard drugs. Thus, these three variables have been mixed with personality variable. </font>

<br>


```{r logit6, message=TRUE}

data2_logit_train1 <- 
  train(consumption_cocaine_last_month ~ . + personality*consumption_amphetamines 
        + personality*consumption_cannabis + personality*consumption_cannabis,
        data = data2,        
        method = "glm",
        family = "binomial",
        metric = "ROC",
        trControl = ctrl_cv5)

data2_logit_train1

```

<br>

<font size=4>We compared previous model to one which do not have any interactions to verify whether they improve our results. The results revaled that model do not differ significantly. Thus, we decided to stay with the last one.</font>

```{r logit26, message=TRUE}

data2_logit_train1 <- 
  train(consumption_cocaine_last_month ~ .,
        data = data2,        
        method = "glm",
        family = "binomial",
        metric = "ROC",
        trControl = ctrl_cv5)

data2_logit_train1

```

<br>

### KNN

<font size=4>One of the biggest advantage of the KNN algorithm is its simplicity. It is quite intuitive method which simply finds K nearest neighbors. Unfortunately, this algorithm is vulnerable to uneven distribution of the explained variable. We believe that upsampling procedure we used might solve that problem.</font>

<br>

```{r knn5}

k_possible = data.frame(k=seq(1,20,1))

data2_knn_train <- 
  train(consumption_cocaine_last_month ~ .,
        data2,        
        method = "knn",
        metric = "ROC",
        trControl = ctrl_cv5,
        tuneGrid = k_possible,
        preProcess = c("range"))

data2_knn_train

```

<br>

```{r knn_plot4}

plot(data2_knn_train)

```

<br>

<font size=4>Based on the graph it we decided to go with k = 9.</font>

<br>

```{r knn_final3}

data2_knn_train$results$k = 9

```

### SVM

<font size=4>The main advantage of SVM algorithm is that we reduce the risk of overfitting. Moreover, the  appropriate kernel function allows to solve any complex problem. However, it also has some disadvantages. Especially, it is difficult to tune proper hyper parameters, cost -C and gamma. We decided to go on with the parameters suggested by algorithm, sigma = 0.03044707 and C = 0.25. </font>

```{r svm2}

parametersC_sigma2 <- 
  expand.grid(C = c(0.1,0.5,0.1),
              sigma = c(0.01,0.05,0.01))

data2_svm_train <- 
  train(consumption_cocaine_last_month ~ .,
        data2,        
        method = "svmRadial",
        metric = "ROC",
        trControl = ctrl_cv5)
        #tuneGrid = parametersC_sigma2)

data2_svm_train

```

<br>

### Random Forest

<font size=4>Additionally, we decided to try new algorithm that we did not have during our classes which was random forest. This method has a couple of advantages that previous ones did not have. Firstly, it is known that this algorithm is popular due to its accuracy. And this is a main reason why we decided to try it out. We believed that our dataset need precise method because it is imbalanced. Moreover, this method also solves the problem of overfitting. 
The important issue in this algorithm is to select proper number of variables randomly sampled as of candidates for each split. We can notice on the graph below that number two variables are characterized with the highest ROC value.</font>

<br>

```{r rf2}

data2_rf_train <- 
  train(consumption_cocaine_last_month ~ .,
        data2,        
        method = "rf",
        metric = "ROC",
        trControl = ctrl_cv5)

plot(data2_rf_train)

```

## Model Evaluation

<font size=4>In order to choose our final model we decided to run predictions on the whole dataset using all algorithms. We used parameters that were selected in our previous steps. We also decided to choose Balanced Accuracy as our final index to evaluate accuracy of our model. </font>

```{r model_evaluation2}

logit_fitted = predict(data2_logit_train1, data2)
logit_results = summary_binary_class(predicted_classes = logit_fitted,
                     real = data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month)

knn_fitted = predict(data2_knn_train, data2)
knn_results = summary_binary_class(predicted_classes = knn_fitted,
                     real = data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month)

svm_fitted = predict(data2_svm_train, data2)
svm_results = summary_binary_class(predicted_classes = svm_fitted,
                     real = data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month)

rf_fitted = predict(data2_rf_train, data2)
rf_results = summary_binary_class(predicted_classes = rf_fitted,
                     real = data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month)

balanced_accuracy  = matrix(1:4, nrow=1, ncol=4)

balanced_accuracy[1,1]=confusionMatrix(as.factor(logit_fitted), data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month)$byClass[11]
balanced_accuracy[1,2]=confusionMatrix(as.factor(knn_fitted), data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month)$byClass[11]
balanced_accuracy[1,3]=confusionMatrix(as.factor(svm_fitted), data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month)$byClass[11]
balanced_accuracy[1,4]=confusionMatrix(as.factor(rf_fitted), data2$consumption_cocaine_last_month)$byClass[11]

colnames(balanced_accuracy) = c("Logit","KNN","SVM","Random Forest")
rownames(balanced_accuracy) = c("Balanced Accuracy")
kable(balanced_accuracy)

print(paste0('The best algorithm for our dataset is ', colnames(balanced_accuracy)[apply(balanced_accuracy,1,which.max)],
             ' with the predicted Balanced Accuracy equals to ', round(balanced_accuracy[apply(balanced_accuracy,1,which.max)]*100,2),'%'))

```
